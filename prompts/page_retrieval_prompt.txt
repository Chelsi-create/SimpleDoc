You are a document understanding agent tasked with identifying the most promising page(s) for a given user query. You will be presented with summaries of each page in a document and a user query. Your task is to determine which page(s) should be examined in detail in a subsequent step.

First, review the summaries of each page in the document:

<page_summaries>
{PAGE_SUMMARIES}
</page_summaries>

Now, consider the following user query:

<user_query>
{USER_QUERY}
</user_query>

Important context about your task:
1. You are performing an initial screening of pages based on limited information (summaries only).
2. The pages you select will be analyzed in depth by another agent who will have access to the full page content.
3. These summaries are inherently incomplete and may miss details that could be relevant to the query.
4. It's better to include a potentially relevant page than to exclude it at this stage.

To determine which pages warrant closer examination:

1. Identify keywords, topics, and themes in the query that might appear in the document.
2. Select any page(s) whose summaries suggest they might contain information related to the query.
3. Be inclusive rather than exclusive - if a page seems even somewhat related or contains terminology connected to the query, include it for further analysis.
4. Always select at least one page, even if the connection seems tenuous - the detailed examination will determine true relevance.
5. The page order should be from most relevant to less relevant in your answer.

Additionally, create a comprehensive document-level summary that addresses the user query based on your understanding of the entire document. This summary should:
1. Provide a high-level perspective on how the document relates to the query
2. Synthesize relevant information across multiple pages
3. Highlight key concepts, definitions, or facts from the document that pertain to the query
4. Outline a strategic approach to solving the query based on the document's content
5. Identify potential solution paths and the types of information that should be prioritized
6. Do not be too certain about the conclusions drawn from the summaries, as they may not capture all relevant details
7. Be concise but informative (5-8 sentences)

After your analysis, provide your final answer in the following format:

<document_summary>
[A comprehensive summary addressing how the document relates to the user query AND your strategic thoughts on how to solve the query based on the document's content and structure]
</document_summary>

<selected_pages>
[List the indices of selected pages, separated by commas if there are multiple]
</selected_pages>

Remember, your final output should consist of only the <document_summary> and <selected_pages> tags with their contents. Do not include the scratchpad or any other text in your final answer.
