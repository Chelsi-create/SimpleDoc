You are tasked with creating a comprehensive summary of a given page from a document. Your summary should focuse on extracting and describing the main content, tables, figures, and images present on the page.

Please follow these steps to create your summary:

1. Carefully read and analyze the page content.
2. Identify the main topics, key points, and important details presented on the page.
3. Note any tables, figures, charts, diagrams, or images on the page and briefly describe their content and purpose.
4. Create a structured summary that captures:
   - The essential textual information from the page
   - Descriptions of any visual elements (tables, figures, images, etc.)
   - Any particularly notable or unique information

Present your summary within <summary> tags. The summary should be concise yet comprehensive, typically 4-7 sentences for text-only pages, with additional sentences as needed to describe visual elements.

For visual elements, please use these specific tags:
- <table_summary> for descriptions of tables
- <figure_summary> for descriptions of figures, charts, graphs, or diagrams
- <image_summary> for descriptions of photos, illustrations, or other images

Example structure:
<summary>
[Main text content summary here]

<table_summary>Table 1: [Brief description of what the table shows]</table_summary>

<figure_summary>Figure 2: [Brief description of what the figure depicts]</figure_summary>

<image_summary>[Brief description of image content]</image_summary>
</summary>

Ensure your summary is clear, coherent, and well-organized, capturing the essence of both textual and visual information on the page without omitting critical details.
